# Android-RTG-Lib
Small lib for drawing Real Time Graphics on Android using canvas.

## About
I developed this lib so I don't have to rewrite this every time I need Real Time Graphics on an Android Studio Project (Mostly games, but I have try to do it "abstract" so it can be used for any app).

I have been developing some "games" using Android Studio. I know it's not ideal, but it's doable. I will create a lib including my stuff for "game dev on Android Studio" sometime.

I will create a Wiki or some docs sometime.


## How to use!
I'm trying Jitpack for releases...

Follow this guide to add AndroidRTG Lib to your projects: https://docs.jitpack.io/

Soryy! I have not written the docs yet, so try to figure it out for now.
